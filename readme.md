Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The calculator will be a command-line based application that takes in user input, performs the necessary calculations, and outputs the result.

My initial though process:--

Here is how the calculator will work:

    When the program starts, it should prompt the user to enter the first number.
    The user should enter a number, and the program should store it in a variable.
    Next, the program should prompt the user to enter the second number.
    The user should enter a number, and the program should store it in a variable.
    Next, the program should prompt the user to enter an operation (+, -, *, or /).
    The user should enter an operation, and the program should store it in a variable.
    Next, the program should perform the appropriate operation (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) on the two numbers and output the result.
